-- DDS — 0152_driver_streaks_action_other_text
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Reported live: Driver Streaks' Action column, for any row logged with the
-- "Other…" option, was showing "Logged from Driver Streaks (09/12/2026–
-- 09/12/2026)" instead of the actual custom action text the person typed.
--
-- Root cause: dds_driver_streaks()'s `lastAction` jsonb only ever exposed
-- `type`/`note`/`by`/`at` from entity_action_log — never `action_other_text`,
-- the column that actually holds the custom description when action_type =
-- 'Other'. The client's actionButtonLabel() (index.html) falls back to
-- `note` to render the "Other…" case, and Driver Streaks' own
-- submitStreakAction() always writes a fixed provenance string into `note`
-- ("Logged from Driver Streaks (<run start>–<run end>)") regardless of the
-- actual action — so the generic provenance string displayed instead of the
-- real custom text, which was correctly stored but never read back.
--
-- dds_driver_asset_weekly() had the identical gap on Driver & Asset
-- Monitoring's resolved-history view — already flagged in a comment at that
-- call site (index.html, "dds_driver_asset_weekly()'s lastAction only
-- carries the raw action_type, never action_other_text") but never fixed
-- until now. Both RPCs get the same one-column addition; nothing else about
-- either function's shape or logic changes.
