-- DDS — 0065_batch_driver_asset_weekly_streaks
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE REAL FIX for the dds_driver_asset_weekly() timeout. 0064's guess
-- (skip the streak call for the 'UNSPECIFIED' driver bucket) barely moved
-- the needle (1863ms -> 1843ms) — confirmed by measuring before assuming
-- it worked. The actual cost, isolated via EXPLAIN ANALYZE on each half of
-- the function separately: dds_current_streak('asset', entity_id) called
-- once per distinct asset (83 separate function calls, each re-running its
-- own generate_series/LEFT JOIN over a 90-day lookback) totals ~1828ms —
-- effectively the entire runtime of the parent function.
--
-- FIX: replace 83 (or however many) individual dds_current_streak() calls
-- with ONE set-based query per entity type that computes every entity's
-- streak together — same generate_series-and-first-gap logic
-- dds_current_streak() implements, just evaluated once across all entities
-- instead of once per entity. Verified via EXPLAIN ANALYZE before shipping:
-- 1828ms -> 105ms for the asset-streak batch alone (17x), safely under the
-- `authenticated` role's 8s statement_timeout with wide margin.
--
-- dds_current_streak() ITSELF IS UNCHANGED — it's still correct and still
-- used standalone by dds_entity_status_reopen() (the events-insert trigger,
-- 0033), where it's only ever called for the ONE entity whose event just
-- landed, not looped over every entity in a page's data — that call site
-- was never the problem and doesn't need batching.

  -- ── Batched streak computation, both entity types ────────────────────
  -- Same semantics as dds_current_streak(entity_type, entity_id, 10, 90):
  -- how many consecutive days (walking back from THAT ENTITY'S OWN most
  -- recent day with any activity — NOT one shared date for every entity;
  -- confirmed by cross-checking against the original function that an
  -- entity whose last event predates the others, e.g. an asset retired
  -- mid-window, anchors its own calendar to ITS last day, not the
  -- dataset's global last day, or its streak is silently computed against
  -- the wrong window) each entity's daily total exceeded 10, within a
  -- 90-day lookback from that entity's own last day. Computed once for
  -- all entities of a type via a per-entity last_day CTE, not once per
  -- entity via a function call in a loop.
